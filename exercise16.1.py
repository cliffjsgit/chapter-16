# Exercise 16.1
#
#
# 1. Write a function called mul_time that takes a Time object and a number and
# returns a new Time object that contains the product of the original Time and 
# the number.
# 
# Then use mul_time to write a function that takes a Time object that represents
# the finishing time in a race, and a number that represents the distance, and 
# returns a Time object that represents the average pace (time per mile).
