#
# Question 1
# 1. The datetime module provides time objects that are similar to the Time 
# objects in this chapter, but they provide a rich set of methods and operators.
# Read the documentation at http://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html.
#

#
# Question 2
# 2. Use the datetime module to write a program that gets the current date and 
# prints the day of the week. Write a program that takes a birthday as input and
# prints the user's age and the number of days, hours, minutes and seconds until
# their next birthday.
#

#
# Question 3
# 3. For two people born on different days, there is a day when one is twice as 
# old as the other. That's their Double Day. Write a program that takes two 
# birthdays and computes their Double Day.
#

#
# Question 4
# 4. For a little more challenge, write the more general version that computes 
# the day when one person is n times older than the other.
